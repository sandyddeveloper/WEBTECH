  <p>
    A lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is a large wild cat native to <strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> and <strong>India</strong>. They are known for their muscular bodies, powerful roars, and distinctive manes (in males). Lions are apex predators, playing a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by regulating herbivore populations.
  </p>

  <h2>Physical Characteristics:</h2>

  <p><strong>Size:</strong><br>
    Lions are large, second only to tigers in size within the cat family.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Body:</strong><br>
    They have strong, compact bodies, powerful forelegs, and sharp teeth and claws.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Mane:</strong><br>
    Adult male lions have a shaggy mane that varies in color from blond to black.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Coat:</strong><br>
    Lions have a yellow-gold coat, and young lions have light spotting that disappears as they mature.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Sexual Dimorphism:</strong><br>
    Male lions are larger and have manes, while females are smaller and lack manes.
  </p>

  <h2>Habitat and Distribution:</h2>

  <p><strong>Africa:</strong><br>
    Lions are found in various habitats across Sub-Saharan Africa, including savannas, grasslands, and forests.
  </p>

  <p><strong>India:</strong><br>
    They are also found in the forests and grasslands of India, particularly in the Gir Forest in Gujarat.
  </p>

  <h2>Social Behavior:</h2>

  <p><strong>Pride:</strong><br>
    Lions typically live in groups called prides, which usually consist of related females and their cubs, with a few dominant males.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Solitary Lions:</strong><br>
    Some populations of lions are solitary, according to National Geographic.
  </p>

  <h2>Diet and Hunting:</h2>

  <p><strong>Carnivores:</strong><br>
    Lions are carnivores, meaning they primarily eat meat.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Prey:</strong><br>
    Their prey includes a variety of animals, such as zebras, wildebeests, antelopes, and even larger prey like buffaloes and rhinoceroses.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Hunting:</strong><br>
    Lions are skilled hunters, using their strength, speed, and teamwork to bring down prey.
  </p>

  <h2>Ecological Role:</h2>

  <p><strong>Apex Predator:</strong><br>
    Lions are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators (except in some cases, like other lions).
  </p>

  <p><strong>Ecosystem Regulation:</strong><br>
    As apex predators, lions play a vital role in regulating herbivore populations and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.
  </p>

  <h2>Conservation Status:</h2>

  <p><strong>Vulnerable:</strong><br>
    African lions are classified as <em>"vulnerable"</em> due to declining populations, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Threats:</strong><br>
    Human-wildlife conflict, habitat loss, climate change, and wildlife trade are major threats to lion populations.
