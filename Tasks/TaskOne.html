    <h1>Presentation Layer – Making the Web Look Good</h1>

    <p>The presentation layer is what users see and use on a website. It includes everything visible like layout,
        colors, text, images, buttons, and animations. This is also called the frontend of a website.</p>

    <h2>1. HTML – The Skeleton</h2>

    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It gives structure to the webpage. Think of it like the skeleton or
        base of a website.</p>

    <p>Example: A heading, a paragraph, an image, a list – all are created using HTML.</p>

    <h2>2. CSS – The Style</h2>

    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style HTML. It adds colors, spacing, fonts, borders, and
        layout designs to the page.</p>

    <p>Think of CSS as decorating your website and making it look attractive.</p>

    <h2>3. JavaScript – The Interaction</h2>

    <p>JavaScript is used to make a website interactive. It helps when you want buttons to do something, forms to work,
        popups to appear, or anything that changes on user action.</p>

    <p>It makes the webpage dynamic and alive.</p>

    <h2>4. React – Smart Way to Build UI</h2>

    <p>React is a JavaScript library made by Facebook. It is used to build user interfaces. It helps you create small
        parts called components like buttons, cards, and menus, which you can reuse easily.</p>

    <p>React is fast, efficient, and widely used for building modern web applications.</p>

    <h2>5. Bootstrap – Quick and Responsive Design</h2>

    <p>Bootstrap is a CSS framework. It gives ready-made design blocks like buttons, forms, grids, and layouts. It helps
        build websites quickly and make them look good on both mobile and desktop screens.</p>

    <p>It saves time and makes your website responsive without writing much CSS from scratch.</p>
